# Expectation Management & Cross-Functional Collaboration

Context:
You have two tasks above (Task 1 & Task 2). Take tomorrow’s date as the original due date for
both tasks. There is a family emergency at your place due to which you won’t be able to meet
the due date of the above tasks for at least 3 more days. Task 1 is for a low-priority customer
who has not provided any go-live date to us. Task 2 is for a priority customer whose campaign
needs to go live in the next 2 days.
Note - You can only ask for an extension for 1 task from the above.
Task:

1. What will be your approach to solving this issue? Explain your strategy and approach to
   this.
2. How will you inform the 2 separate account managers of both customers about your
   approach? Write an internal message informing Manoj (Account manager for Task 1) &
   Ravi (Account Manager for Task 2) about your respective approach.
3. How will you communicate the delay of additional 3 days to the customer? (Write an
   email to the customer informing them about this).
