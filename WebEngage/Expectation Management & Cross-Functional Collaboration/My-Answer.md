# My Approach:

>As Given the priority customer's campaign needs to go live in the next 2 days, I would prioritize Task 2 over Task 1 and ask for an extension only for Task 1. I would then work on Task 2 as per the original due date and try to complete it within the next 2 days. As for Task 1, I would work on it after completing Task 2 and deliver it to the customer as soon as possible after the original due date.

### Internal Message:


*** Subject: Update on Tasks 1 & 2  ***

>Dear Manoj & Ravi,

>I hope this email finds you well.

 > I wanted to reach out to both of you regarding the two tasks assigned to me, Task 1 and Task 2. Due to a family emergency, I won't be able to meet the original due date for both tasks for the next 3 days.

> Given the priority customer's campaign needs to go live in the next 2 days, I would like to request an extension only for Task 1. I will be completing Task 2 as per the original due date and will deliver it to you within the next 2 days. I will then work on Task 1 and deliver it to the customer as soon as possible after the original due date.
